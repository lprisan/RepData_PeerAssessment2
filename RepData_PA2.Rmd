Title summarizing results (TBC!)
========================================================

## Synopsis

Summarize the whole thing in at most 10 sentences!

## Data processing

Includes text and code to download and process the data, starting with the raw csv (maybe put the download-unzip commented before, also use cache=TRUE)

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the **Help** toolbar button for more details on using R Markdown).

When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# The first time you download the code, you can run the downloading and extraction of the data
# setwd("/home/lprisan/workspace/Coursera/ReproducibleResearch/RepData_PeerAssessment2")
# download.file("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2", "RepData_PA2-data.bz2", "wget")
rawdata <- read.csv(bzfile("RepData_PA2-data.bz2"))
summary(rawdata)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(cars)
```


## Results

Including at least one figure, and at most three! (they can be multiplot). Show all the code! ensure echo=TRUE...
